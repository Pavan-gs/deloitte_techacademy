Lab 1
=====
Creating VNet

1. Create a Virtual Network (ip range --> 10.0.0.0/16-->65536 ip)
2. Let's have two subnets, 1 for Web servers (10.0.1.0/24), 
and another one for DB servers (10.0.2.0/24)
3. Create and configure NSG --> public nsg(public subnet) --> allow inbound(http,https,ssh), 
private nsg(private subnet) --> allow inbound(sql, (10.0.1.0/24), ssh((10.0.1.0/24))

DNS set-up
option 1 --> under vm, networking, configdns label(pvn-demo) and then access
http://pvn-demo.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/

option 2 --> buy a domain from registrar


Security
Security Center (Defender cloud) --> JIT (Just in time)
Key vault --> Secret, Keys, Certificates management, storing secrets with Hardware Security Model (HSM) 
Sentinel --> To detect and respond to threats
Active directory (Entra id)
Policy
Dedicated Hosts --> Private servers for compliance

Network Security Groups --> Firewall, filter inbound & outbound traffic
Application Security Group --> Grouping of servers with similar ports, functions like web servers

Az CLI, POWERSHELL, CLOUD SHELL
===============================
1. creating resource group --> az group create --name networkingdemoRG --location eastus
2. creating vnet --> az network vnet create --resource-group networkingdemoRG 
--name pvnvnet --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16 --location eastus
3. Crating a subnet --> az network vnet subnet create --resource-group networkingdemoRG 
--vnet-name pvnvnet --name Publicsubnet --address-prefixes 10.0.1.0/24
4. Same commands works in Powershell(best for windows ad/admins)
5. Cloud shell is browser based for ex, az account show, az resource list --resource-group networkingdemoRG

Managed Services
================
Storage
Database
Data Warehouse
Integration
Streaming
Visualisation
AI/ML

Storage
=======
PAAS
Managed cloud storage service --> High availability, durable, scalable & redundant storage.
Service to store files, messages, tables & any other types of information. 
Also used for VM's which includes disk and files.

1 subscription --> 100 accounts --> 1 account * 500 tb
durability --> 99.9999999999 (11) with replication
secured encryption, entra id integration, access controls
Cost effective --> pay as you use

3 categories
============
1. Storage for VM's (disks & files)
2. Unstructured data (blobs, datalake stores)
3. Structured data (Tables, SQL db, cosmos db)

Types of AZ storage
===================
1. Blobs --> Object storage --> Huge amount of unstructured data such as text, images, videos, data for back-up, 
archiving,disaster recovery, binary data
2. Files --> Highly available network file sharing over SMB (Server Message Block) --> Suitable for migration of 
the data
3. Tables --> Store structured data (SQL, NOSQL), key-value pair, schema less design
4. Queues --> Store & Retrieve Messages, each message of maximum size 64 kb --> Store millions of messages
5. Disk --> For VM disks, like your server's hard drive

Types of blob storages
======================
Block blobs --> Any text, files, videos, images etc. saved in blob storage are by default saves as block blobs (max size-->  5 pb)
Page blobs --> Random access files upto 8 tb --> virtual hard drive --> serves as a disk for VM's
Append blobs --> Made up of multiple block blobs, optimized for append operations --> 
ideal for log data analysis in VM

Performance / access tiers
==========================
Hot --> Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently like VM, files, images, 
videos that are in regular use storage cost (high), read cost (low)

Cool --> Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for atleast 30 days 
like back-up data storage cost (low), read cost (higher than hot)

Cold (Archive) --> Optimized for storing data that is rarely accesses and stored for atleast 
180 days with flexible latency storage cost (least), read cost (highest)

Storage Replication
====================
Local Redundancy Storage --> 3 copies of data in 3 different storage boxes within same data center
Geo RS --> 3 copies of data in primary region, 3 copies in secondary region
Zone RS --> 3 copies of data in multiple data centers within same region
GZRS --> Same as ZRS, single physical location in secondary region
Read only GRS --> Same as GRS, Read only Access in secondary region
RA-ZRS --> Same as ZRS, Read only Access in secondary region

Performance
===========
Standard --> Backed by HDD (magnetic drives), Lowest cost per gb, best for applications that 
requires bulk storage, infrequent data access

Premium --> Backed by SSD (Solid State drives), offers low latency & consistant performance, 
use with Azure's VM disks, best for data , i/o intensive applications --> DB

General Purpose V1 --> Legacy, doesn't support any performancy tiers, standard and premium, (doesn't support ZRS, GZRS)
General Purpose V2 --> Performance tiers, all Replications, standard and premium
Blob storage --> Unstructured data, (append blobs, block blobs)

Blob Containers & categories
============================
Containers --> Directory structure, can store many blobs under one container

1. Creating storage account
2. Access the account from Explorer using access keys
3. Using SAS url for blob
4. Generating and using SAS url for Containers
5. Create alerts for ingress, egress in Monitor

# Access Keys --> are given if you would like to give account level access --> High risk
You can always rotate the keys to make older keys invalid
by default 2 access keys are given

# SAS --> Temporary, timed(validity), scoped(read only, write only, list, delete)

Make storage account as public then anonymous users can access with a url
Suppose your container is public but account is restricted to public, then can't access with url

# Access policy

Data lake GEN1 
Data lake GEN2 --> Big Data

Versioning

To upgrade blob storage to data lake gen 2 from CLI
admin>az storage account hns-migration start --type validation -n pvnstorage8 -g pvn-rg
admin>az storage account hns-migration start --type upgrade -n pvnstorage8 -g pvn-rg 
az storage account show --name pvnstorage8 --resource-group pvn-rg --query isHnsEnabled

ADLS2
=====
Combines the best features of Data lake Analytics (Hadoop compatible, Optimized drivers) 
and Blob storage (Low cost, storage tiers, high availability)

Scalable, secured & managed data lake.
6 layers of protection for security & compliance

1. Network Security --> Firewalls, Private & Service endpoints
2. Authentication --> MFA, Service Principal, AAD
3. Authorisation --> RBAC, ACL's, POSIX
4. Data encryption --> SSE, CSE,  Key-vault, EKM
5. Data Access Controls --> Lifecycle management policies, retention policies, data expiration
6. Monitoring & auditing --> Az monitor, Log analytics

Features		Blob				ADLS Gen2
========		====				=========
Top level Organisation	Containers			Containers

Low level Organisation	Virtual directory		Directory

Data containers		Blobs				Files

Soft delete		Yes				Yes

Static Website		Yes				Yes

RBAC			Yes				Yes

Access Control Lists	No				Yes

SAS			Yes				Yes

Access Keys		Yes				Yes


ADLS2 is better than Blob storage in performance, security, scalability but costlier than blob storage
It stores a new version for each file modification. Can be accessed using version history, can do retrieval or deletion.

V-core based purchasing model (Precise ctrl)--> choose the number of vcores, memory, speed, 
also utilise hybrid (integrate/use your existing sql server licenses) 

DTU based purchasing model --> blend of compute, memory, I/O resources in 3 service tiers to support light weight to heavy db workloads.
Compute size s within each tier provides a different mix of these resources.

Deployment models
=================
Single DB -- Isolated & portable , contained, own set of resources
Elastic pool --> Collection of single db's, shared set of resources, cost effective if the usage is unpredictable
Hyperscale --> For massive scale-up to to 100 tb, with fast back-up (every seconds)
